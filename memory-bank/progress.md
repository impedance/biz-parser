# Progress Log — BizDocument Parser

## Status Summary (2025-10-23)
- ✅ PRD established outlining scope, success metrics, and stakeholders.
- ✅ Execution plan (`plan.md`) rewritten for coding-agent workflow.
- ✅ Memory Bank initialised with foundational context.
- ⏳ Spec fixtures pending transcription (Phase A deliverable).
- ⏳ Parser implementation not started; awaiting fixture capture and project scaffolding.

## Upcoming Milestones
1. Populate `tests/fixtures/` with all BizDocumentAI example pairs.
2. Draft TypeScript domain models (`src/models.ts`) aligned with spec and PRD.
3. Scaffold parser infrastructure (tokeniser + recursive descent) with initial unit tests.

## Risks & Watch Items
- Missing example data from the PDF may delay parser development—prioritise manual transcription early.
- Ambiguity around list nesting markers requires clarification once fixtures are assembled.
