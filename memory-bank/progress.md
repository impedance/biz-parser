# Progress Log — BizDocument Parser

## Status Summary (2025-10-23)
- ✅ PRD established outlining scope, success metrics, and stakeholders.
- ✅ Execution plan (`plan.md`) rewritten for coding-agent workflow.
- ✅ Memory Bank initialised with foundational context.
- ✅ Spec fixtures transcribed; see `docs/spec-examples.md` and `tests/fixtures/`.
- ⏳ Parser implementation not started; awaiting domain model alignment and project scaffolding.

## Upcoming Milestones
1. Draft TypeScript domain models (`src/models.ts`) aligned with the captured fixtures.
2. Scaffold parser infrastructure (tokeniser + recursive descent) with initial unit tests.
3. Wire up fixture-driven tests to validate early parser increments.

## Risks & Watch Items
- Dictionary outputs omit the separator field even for custom delimiters—ensure downstream models do not assume it exists.
- List marker metadata beyond numbering (`kind`, bullet symbol) is not yet represented in fixtures; revisit if later requirements demand it.
