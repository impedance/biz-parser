# Product Context â€” BizDocument Parser

## Problem Space
Enterprise content (contracts, procedures, policies) currently exists as semi-structured text. Without reliable parsing, AI assistants cannot ingest this material with consistent context or metadata.

## Solution Vision
Create a parser that recognises BizDocumentAI tags (`<block>`, `<head>`, `<dict>`, `<list>`, etc.), producing structured blocks that capture numbering, headings, and nested content exactly as defined in `requirements.pdf`. This enables downstream indexing, search, and RAG pipelines to reason over business documents without manual curation.

## Users & Beneficiaries
- **AI Platform Engineers:** integrate parser outputs into ingestion and retrieval workflows.
- **Content Operations & Analysts:** rely on deterministic parsing instead of manual tagging.
- **Support & QA Teams:** require readable errors and fixtures to diagnose malformed documents.

## Value Proposition
- Automates data structuring for BizDocumentAI documents.
- Reduces onboarding time for new agents/developers via consistent data models.
- Provides a foundation for future extensions (additional tags, validation tooling).
